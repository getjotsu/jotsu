# React App based on create-react-app/react-router-dom

## Quick Start

Create a `.env` file with your Jotsu account ID, e.g.
```
REACT_APP_ACCOUNT_ID=123456
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Notes:
* [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) added to `index.html` for default styling.
* Added `basedUrl`: 'src' to tsconfig.json.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
