# Contributing to Jotsu


## Publishing
Use lerna and npm to build.

```shell
npm install
npm run build
lerna publish --no-private
```


## Examples

```shell
npm install
npm run start
```

Note: `npm i` will install needed Jotsu libraries from NPM.   
If you want to instead build against the current source tree, delete the `@jotsu` subdirectory in `node_modules`.
